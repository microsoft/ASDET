# Multivariate Time Series Analysis

What are time series? Time series are a way for us to measure one or more variables with respect to time. This is useful because it can help us identify trends that may occur during certain time periods. In our case, we are modelling the distinct values within a feature per hour (e.g. number of distinct client IP addresses) using the MSTICpy Time Series package.  Using our models, we form a composite image of the feature set during a set time period and generate a set of graphs that display anomalous features, as well as a stylized output of the raw data.

The multivariate time series notebook provides an example notebook for how you would preform time series analysis on a sample dataset.
