# Notebooks for Anomaly Detection

## Isolation Forest

TBD

## Time Series

The multivariate time series notebook contains an example of detecting anomalies in multivariate time series data. This notebook relies on the time series modules created by the MSTICpy team. Provided a table, a timeframe, and a set of features the notebook generates a set of anomalous features within that timeframe. It then allows the user to visualize the specific features that are anomalous.
